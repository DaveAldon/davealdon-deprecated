        "content"  : "<p>If “God hates sin but loves the sinner,” then why did he always punish sinners and not the sin? Because that very common statement just isn’t supported by scripture whatsoever. There are countless little sayings like this that exist with the sole purpose of cushioning tough messages that really have simple, encouraging explanations. So today we’re tackling this one, “God hates sin but loves the sinner,” and why it can be confusing to believe both it and scripture that contradicts it entirely. So enough of sayings that people come up with, let’s look at what God has to say.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/pexels/hate.jpg\" alt=\"Woman punching man\" /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“I have loved Jacob, but Esau I have hated.” - Malachi 1:2-3</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So immediately in the verse above, we see that God is capable of hating someone. But why? Isn’t God all-loving? Isn’t this contrary to his nature? Does this make you uncomfortable at all? Well it should, because that means the wheels are starting to turn. So let’s look at what God’s hatred is exactly, and what that means for us.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"covenant-hatred\">Covenant Hatred</h3>\n\n<p>The first point is to make the clear distinction between love and hate in the eyes of God. God’s love is a covenant, not an emotion. Therefore, God’s hatred, the opposite of his covenant love, must not be an emotion either, but a choice:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Lord preserves all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy. - Psalm 145:20</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But doesn’t God love <em>everyone</em>? How is it possible for him to decide to hate someone, and therefore destroy them?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committed, and get a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, O house of Israel? For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent and live! - Ezekiel 18:31-32</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Esau and his people did not repent and live. Take five minutes to read the book of Obadiah, and don’t be scared, it’s only one chapter. It describes the wickedness of Esau’s people, and you’ll see that God’s hatred is fully justified. Not the emotion of hatred, but the covenant of hatred: that conscious choice of Esau to sin and live against God. And God’s side of the agreement is to destroy Esau.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For the violence against your brother Jacob, shame shall cover you, and you shall be cut off forever. - Obadiah 1:10</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This covenant of hatred is made even more clear in Genesis, where the agreement that whoever sins will be destroyed is first made known to God’s creation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“But you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.” - Genesis 2:17</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"gods-love-comes-first\">God’s Love Comes First</h3>\n\n<p>If God hated Esau and destroyed him because of his sin, what about you and me? We’ve done the same, we’ve sinned, we’ve rebelled against God just like Esau. Does that mean God hates us too?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. - 2 Corinthians 5:21</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Because God <em>loves everyone</em> so much, Jesus took on all of his Father’s hatred. Before he died on the cross he quotes King David, exclaiming God’s rejection and hatred of him:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? - Psalm 22:1</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As said in Ezekiel, God does not delight in destroying sinners. He loves us all far too much for that. This was the purpose of Jesus: to save us from the result of our sin, which is God’s hatred and our destruction.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. - John 3:17-18</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-do-we-respond\">How Do We Respond?</h3>\n\n<p>If we are called to imitate God, and if he has hatred for people, shouldn’t we have hatred as well? Not so fast! We’ve been describing hatred as a contract, an agreement to someone to be destroyed for rebelling against God. But Jesus took on that hatred so that we wouldn’t be condemned. So what are we supposed to do?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To fear the LORD is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. - Proverbs 8:13</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s fine, that’s hating what the person is doing, right?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord, and abhor those who are in rebellion against you? I have nothing but hatred for them; I count them my enemies. - Psalm 139:21-22</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Oh dear! Now what? Are we <em>really</em> supposed to hate people who hate God? Even though Jesus literally says the following?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.” - Matthew 5:44</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Remember, this hatred is <em>not</em> the emotion that brings about vengeance, grudges, or murder, for the Old Testament makes it clear:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the Lord. - Leviticus 19:18</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This hatred is a moral repugnance of what’s going on inside someone who hates God. This Psalmist is exemplifying the very beginning of Psalms itself:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers. - Psalm 1:1</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The enemies of God are certainly not our friends! The Psalmist in chapter 139 is calling them out clearly, because we should <em>not</em> forget what’s going on, and how we are not to walk in the steps of the enemies of God. Jesus wants us to love them, but remember that they are not our brothers and sisters. Because if they <em>were</em>, then we are absolutely not to have any of this hatred for them, just like how God doesn’t hate his own people:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister is still in the darkness. - 1 John 2:9</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"is-there-hope-for-gods-enemies\">Is There Hope For God’s Enemies?</h3>\n\n<p>Is there hope? Yes. One day you will die, and if you die an enemy of God, you will not have eternal life. But while you are living, God will still work in your life to draw you back, but that has to be your decision. Still not sure? Reread Obadiah again, and pay attention to the signs that come to the enemies of God:</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"god-will-humble-you\">God will humble you</h4>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>See, I will make you small among the nations; you will be utterly despised. - Obadiah 1:2</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4 id=\"you-will-lose-what-you-love\">You will lose what you love</h4>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But how Esau will be ransacked, his hidden treasures pillaged! - Obadiah 1:6</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-friends-will-turn-their-backs-on-you\">Your friends will turn their backs on you</h4>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All your allies will force you to the border; your friends will deceive and overpower you; those who eat your bread will set a trap for you, but you will not detect it. - Obadiah 1:7</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4 id=\"nothing-will-make-sense-anymore\">Nothing will make sense anymore</h4>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“In that day,” declares the Lord, “will I not destroy the wise men of Edom,\nthose of understanding in the mountains of Esau?” - Obadiah 1:8</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4 id=\"and-if-you-still-wont-turn-back-to-god\">And if you still won’t turn back to God…</h4>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Jacob will be a fire and Joseph a flame; Esau will be stubble, and they will set him on fire and destroy him. There will be no survivors from Esau. - Obadiah 1:18</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So turn to God now, profess that he is Lord and believe that Jesus died for your sins, and you will be saved! God’s hatred is powerful, and is a result of rebelling against the free gift that Jesus offers us. God wants to give us salvation from a life of sin, and forgiveness for going against him. He doesn’t want to have a covenant of hatred with us, but a covenant of love. But he won’t wait forever, so now is the time!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am writing to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. - 1 John 2:12</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"one-last-passage\">One Last Passage</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>See to it that no one fail to obtain the grace of God; that no “root of bitterness” spring up and cause trouble, and by it the many become defiled; that no one be immoral or irreligious like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal. For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears. - Hebrews 12:15-17</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

They’re all very different emotions, and God has them too, but in a far more interesting way.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/pexels/compassion.jpg\" alt=\"Soldier giving food to kids\" /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him. - Psalm 103:13</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/portfolio/emotion-infographic.png\" alt=\"Infographic of pity, sympathy, empathy, compassion\" /></p>\n\n<p>This infographic was created for a <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201505/empathy-vs-sympathy\">blog</a> post explaining these four emotions, and how each one escalates the amount of engagement. While we experience them at different times, God is able to exhibit <em>all</em> of these at all times. He simultaneously acknowledges, cares about, has experienced, and works to ease our suffering. Let’s jump right in and see this is action.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"moses\">Moses</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The LORD said, “I have indeed seen the misery of My people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their oppressors, and I am aware of their sufferings. I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey…” - Exodus 3:7-8</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>God has <em>seen</em> their pain, <em>heard</em> their pain, and is fully aware. This is pity, but the unique nature of God is increasingly showing us that he doesn’t experience only pity, but simultaneously escalates his engagement with our suffering, as it says here when describing God’s pity:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For he delivers the needy when he calls, the poor and him who has no helper. He has pity on the weak and the needy, and saves the lives of the needy. From oppression and violence he redeems their life, and precious is their blood in his sight. - Psalm 72:12-14</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s not enough that he has pity: by his nature he must care, he must have experienced what we feel, and he must do something about it. Continuing from the passage in Exodus, we see that “I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians.” God immediately is going to do something about Israel’s suffering, which is compassion, his final engagement level. But wait, didn’t we skip something? We saw how God shows pity, which by his nature described in Psalm must be followed by sympathy and compassion, for “precious is their blood in his sight,” and “from oppression and violence he redeems their life,” respectively. So what about empathy? The one in between sympathy and compassion? Does God feel all of our pain? Did God feel Israel’s same suffering at any point, allowing him to have empathy? When did God ever experience, as Exodus describes Israel’s plight, oppression and suffering?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He was oppressed and afflicted - Isaiah 53:7</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering - Isaiah 53:4</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This happened to Jesus, who is God. Even though to us Jesus suffered after Israel’s enslavement, to God and Isaiah, it was already done for the one who lives outside of time:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“For thus said the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy,” - Isaiah 57:15</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.” - 2 Peter 3:8</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>God, at all points in time, had pity, sympathy, empathy, and compassion on Israel. He <em>heard</em> their cries, was <em>concerned</em> for them, had <em>experienced</em> full well what they were going through, and had a <em>plan</em> to help bring them out. This is God’s perfect response to people’s pain. And if God does something, you can be sure he’ll do it again. Let’s look at another Old Testament passage next.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"elijah\">Elijah</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, “May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them.”\nElijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there, while he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness. He came to a broom bush, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. “I have had enough, Lord,” he said. “Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors.” Then he lay down under the bush and fell asleep.\nAll at once an angel touched him and said, “Get up and eat.” He looked around, and there by his head was some bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again.\nThe angel of the Lord came back a second time and touched him and said, “Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you.” So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God. There he went into a cave and spent the night. - 1 Kings 19:1-8</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When Elijah prays, it wasn’t enough that God heard him and took his time answering the prayer. An Angel was <em>already</em> there. God <em>heard</em> Elijah with his pity, <em>cared</em> about his problem with his sympathy, has <em>experienced</em> being on the run with his empathy, and <em>fed</em> the prophet with his compassion. But how has God experienced people trying to kill him? How can God empathize with Elijah?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And when the chief priests and the scribes heard it, they kept looking for a way to kill him; for they were afraid of him, because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching. - Mark 11:18</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is right after Jesus comes to the temple and overturns tables, saying, “Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers.” The priests want him dead, just like how Jezebel wanted Elijah dead for the same reason of driving out blasphemy. So God has certainly gone through what Elijah was experiencing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"why-does-this-matter\">Why Does This Matter</h3>\n\n<p>So what if God shows pity, sympathy, empathy, and compassion all simultaneously and perfectly in response to our pain? So what? Well, we are called so many times to be like Jesus that the more we understand his nature, the more we can be more like him.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked. - 1 John 2:6</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But how can we exhibit the emotions we’ve gone over like God? How can we simultaneously have perfect balance of pity, sympathy, empathy, and compassion? We can’t without listening, we can’t without caring, we can’t without suffering, and we can’t while we give into omission. Sin stops this from happening, but God gives us guidance on where to begin, and that’s where this post will end:</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"pity\">Pity</h4>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger. - James 1:19</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4 id=\"sympathy\">Sympathy</h4>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. - Romans 12:15</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4 id=\"empathy\">Empathy</h4>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them, and those who are mistreated, since you also are in the body. - Hebrews 13:3</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4 id=\"compassion\">Compassion</h4>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Above all, love one another deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. Show hospitality to one another without complaining. - 1 Peter 4:8-9</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whoever oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker, but whoever is kind to the needy honors God. - Proverbs 14:31</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

        "content"  : "<p>Today we turn to how God doesn’t treat his people different from others. This message is simple, but will illustrate how God loves everyone and has his eyes on all nations, wanting everyone to be saved. We’ll use the Jews in the old testament as an example of this, among other powerful scripture. This small topic is important to understand because we know that God punished Israel on many occasions, and also punished other sinful nations. But God also blessed Israel and delivered them from great difficulties. Because God is impartial, that means he also saves nations other than Israel, and delivers them from their difficulties as well. With this, we can better understand God’s love for everyone, and more about what Jesus really meant with this verse:</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. - Matthew 5:45</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/pexels/impartial.jpeg\" alt=\"Vendor selling food\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-jews-werent-the-only-ones\">The Jews weren’t the only ones</h3>\n\n<p>To think that God only cared about the Jews in the old testament is a common belief today, but it simply isn’t true.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Are not you Israelites the same to me as the Cushites?” declares the Lord. “Did I not bring Israel up from Egypt, the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Arameans from Kir?” - Amos 9:7</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the end all, be all to the fact that God was working in the lives of everyone, not just Israel. Cush, Philistia, and other nations were often the enemies of Israel and full of evil, why would God care about delivering them from their own enemies? Because God isn’t just the God of Israel, but the God of SAVING. He loves to save, no matter who it is. But there’s more in case it’s still not clear.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"anyone-can-make-a-covenant-with-god\">Anyone can make a covenant with God</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient. - Hebrews 11:31</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rahab was not a Jew and was a prostitute! But still because she had faith God didn’t care who she was. He would have waited for anyone in Jericho, because his eyes weren’t just on Joshua. But what about those who didn’t make deals with Israel?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"god-is-at-work-in-all-nations\">God is at work in all nations</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A time is coming when the Lord Almighty will receive offerings from this land divided by rivers, this strong and powerful nation, this tall and smooth-skinned people, who are feared all over the world. They will come to Mount Zion, where the Lord Almighty is worshiped. - Isaiah 18:7</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This verse is concerning Ethiopia, a nation not connected to Israel through deals or lineage. God didn’t just look at the Jews, he saw everyone. And we see this prophecy about Ethiopia coming to worship God fulfilled in the new testament:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And there was an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah. - Acts 8:27-28</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Israel was God’s chosen people, but that didn’t mean they were the only ones he cared about. What were they chosen for, anyway? They were chosen to be the nation that the messiah would be born from:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Lord says, “The time is coming when I will choose as king a righteous descendant of David. That king will rule wisely and do what is right and just throughout the land.” - Jeremiah 23:5</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Israel was NOT chosen to be the only ones given deliverance from their enemies, or the only ones allowed salvation.</p>\n\n<p>God really doesn’t care who you are, he has his eyes on you and has plans for you. No matter who you are, there will be times of deliverance and times of pain. God saved the Philistines from their enemies, Israel from their captors, Ethiopia from defeat, and he wants to save you too. His promise is not an easy life, but salvation. And his promise has always been for everyone, because not only can God deliver any nation, whether they’re righteous or unrighteous, but Christians are all the same to him as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. - Galatians 3:28</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, let’s return to the original verse we looked at, and expand on it. With this understanding of God’s love for everyone and not just Israel, we know that deliverance is for all nations, and in the old testament God was looking closely at everything going on.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”  - Matthew 5:45-48</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>God is not like the tax collectors, he loves even those who don’t love him. He greeted those who weren’t Jews, unlike the pagans. God sees everyone and is ready to save because he is impartial and perfect.</p>\n"

        "content"  : "<p>As we get closer to celebrating Christmas, we often turn to the New Testament for relevant scripture and stories surrounding the arrival of Jesus. But recently a lot of things that stick out to me in scripture are the details we often overlook in order to get to the “good” parts. So what’s overlooked in New Testament stories about Jesus being born? The answer today is the Old Testament, and the angel who showed up to explain things.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who looked like a man. And I heard a man’s voice from the Ulai calling, “Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision.” Daniel 8:15-16</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/pexels/angel.jpeg\" alt=\"Angel statue\" /></p>\n\n<p>The angel Gabriel shows up several times in the Old and New Testament. Why is this so important to talk about? Because when we connect Gabriel’s interactions together, we see a bigger picture of who God is. There are three interactions involving Gabriel that I’m going to go through, and they show us what it takes for God to look on us with favor, that Jesus’ birth was predicted to the very day, and that our prayers are answered before we’re even finished.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"zechariah\">Zechariah</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. - Luke 1:10-12</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the first time in the New Testament that Gabriel shows up, and it’s while Zechariah is amidst the presence of God in the temple. People are praying outside, and Zechariah is acknowledging God in his obedience to his tribe’s ancient duty, which we understand from Numbers:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, place fire from the altar in it, and add incense. Go quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, because wrath has come out from the LORD; the plague has begun.” - Numbers 16:46</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We know God is pleased by this, because God wants us to acknowledge him in all we do:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings. - Hosea 6:6</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Gabriel then predicts the birth of Zechariah’s son, John the Baptist:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.” - Luke 1:13</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>God was pleased with Zechariah, and while this man was in the presence of God in the temple, God sent Gabriel to talk about how he’s going to answer his prayers. We know God looked on Zechariah with favor, as it talks about him and his wife:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord’s commands and decrees blamelessly. - Luke 1:6</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>God could have sent Gabriel at any time in Zechariah’s life to tell him that he was going to have a child. But God chose a time cast by lots, a time when Zechariah would be uniquely positioned in the presence of God in the temple.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. - Luke 1:9</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>God looks favorably on us when we acknowledge him and pray. Today we don’t need to be in a temple to be in the presence of God, because Jesus is here with us. We know this because another name he’s known by is Immanuel, which means “God with us.”</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mary\">Mary</h3>\n\n<p>Gabriel shows up a second time in the New Testament, under similar circumstances as the first:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin’s name was Mary. And he came to her and said, “Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!” - Luke 1:26-28</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mary, like Zechariah, was living a life in acknowledgement of God. God is pleased by this, like in Hosea 6:6, as Gabriel describes Mary as “favored one.” But the tasks God gives Gabriel are all the same, and it always revolves around talking about the future. Gabriel continues:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.” - Luke 1:30-31</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What makes this interaction with Mary special enough to talk about? It shows us again that God is pleased with us when we acknowledge him, and he wants to work wonderful things in our lives as a result. It’s also a fulfillment of Gabriel’s interaction with Daniel hundreds of years prior, which sparked the creation of this post. We’ll look at Daniel next.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"daniel\">Daniel</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While I was still in prayer, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice. - Daniel 9:21</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Daniel, a prophet of God, is a righteous man and is in full acknowledgment of God during his prayer. Gabriel, whom Daniel is well acquainted with already due to past interactions, talks about the same thing he talked to Zechariah and Mary about: someone new coming! Gabriel goes on to say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Know and understand this: From the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven ‘sevens,’ and sixty-two ‘sevens.’” - Daniel 9:25</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To understand Gabriel’s math, check <a href=\"https://www.compellingtruth.org/seventy-sevens.html\">this article out</a> and you’ll see that these periods of “sevens” end around 30 AD, the death of Jesus.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“After the sixty-two ‘sevens,’ the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing.” - Daniel 9:26</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s incredible that Jesus’ life and death was predicted with such detail and precision, and by none other than Gabriel, who gets to talk about Jesus over a period of almost half a millennium! So Daniel adds one more example to the pile showing that Jesus’ coming and death was prophesied repeatedly in the Old Testament. But there’s one more message I wanted to talk about, a message we can more easily be encouraged by. Gabriel says to Daniel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“As soon as you began to pray, a word went out, which I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed.” - Daniel 9:23</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>God answered Daniel’s prayer for mercy over Israel BEFORE he even finished! Know that when you pray according to his will, which is favorable, God hears you and is working well before you’re done!</p>\n\n<p>So to reiterate, understand that God works in us when we acknowledge him and find favor with him, Jesus was talked about all throughout the Old Testament and was predicted to the day, and that God answers our prayers before we’re even finished!</p>\n\n<p>We can look back today at the intricacies of God’s plan, and look forward to celebrating Christmas this year, which marked the beginning of the fulfillment of all prophesy. So pray like Daniel and find favor with God, because God is eager to work in your life, just like how he worked in Zechariah, Mary, and Daniel’s lives too:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your sake, Lord, look with favor on your desolate sanctuary. Give ear, our God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy. Lord, listen! Lord, forgive! Lord, hear and act! For your sake, my God, do not delay, because your city and your people bear your Name.” - Daniel 9:17-19</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

        "content"  : "<p>Temptation comes from many sources, which people mostly attribute directly to Satan. But if that was the only source, then Adam and Eve would have probably never sinned. So where else do sinful decisions come from? There are many things described negatively in the Bible, and one in particular is spoiled in the title of this post: our heart. In fact, even Satan himself is not as deceitful as our heart, and we know this because of this very blunt description:</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The human heart is the most deceitful of all things, and desperately wicked. Who really knows how bad it is? - Jeremiah 17:9</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is the MOST deceitful of all things. So the question is how do we combat this? We’re given plenty of instruction to resist Satan, but how do we defeat our deceitful heart, the greatest liar of them all?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/pexels/listening.jpeg\" alt=\"Mossy cross grave\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"listen-to-something-else\">Listen to Something Else</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Those who trust in themselves are fools, but those who walk in wisdom are kept safe. - Proverbs 28:26</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you’re listening to your heart, you’re listening to something that’s a part of you. You’re listening to yourself. Scripture describes all over the place how this is bad. But whenever you turn to wise people, you begin to stop following your heart, and instead leading it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Where there is no guidance the people fall, but in abundance of counselors there is victory. - Proverbs 11:14</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And even when we are alone, and our heart is crowding our desires and confusing us, God is ultimately our counselor.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them. - Hebrews 7:25</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Listening to people in our lives can be a lot easier than listening to God. While choosing the right wise people to listen to is an entirely different discussion, learning to listen to God instead of our heart is another essential starting point. This is because he helps us know who to talk to. If you want to learn more about how to listen to God, check out my previous post <a href=\"http://davealdon.com/2018/10/10/how-does-god-communicate-with-you.html\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-bad-example\">The Bad Example</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful, and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, “She is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.” Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept with her. - 2 Samuel 11:2-4</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Who did King David consult before sleeping with Bathsheba, a married woman? How did he come to this conclusion? In this part of the King of the Jews’ life, where was God? There’s a simple answer: he didn’t ask anyone, his heart made the conclusion for him, and God was always there but never invited into the situation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But the thing David had done displeased the Lord. - 2 Samuel 11:27</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"make-your-heart-a-follower\">Make Your Heart a Follower</h3>\n\n<p>The first and most important step to stop listening to your heart is to follow something else. Push your heart to follow something other than yourself. Begin by praying and asking God to help you change, consider the people he has placed in your life and how they can help you make decisions, and when you’re alone then look at scripture for an example of someone who has gone through the same thing as you, and what God wanted them to do. But first you need to acknowledge the deceitfulness of your heart, and that something needs to change. Because there will be trouble if you follow your heart, God guarantees this.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth. Walk in the ways of your heart and the sight of your eyes. But know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment. - Ecclesiastes 11:9</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

        "content"  : "<p>People pray in many different ways, whether it’s more formal, written and practiced, or casually and in a conversational manner. Either way, it’s how we consciously communicate with God. But because God knows our thoughts and desires before we tell them to him, what’s the point of praying?</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Your Father knows what you need before you ask him. - Matthew 6:8</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/pexels/pray.jpeg\" alt=\"Mossy cross grave\" /></p>\n\n<p>Why talk if someone already knows what you’re going to say? In the context of prayer, the short answer is because if we don’t then we’ll spiritually die. But this post is also about the encouragement God gives us to start praying even if we’re not sure how. Prayer ultimately brings us to life and draws us closer to God. We’ll look at examples in the Bible about why you needn’t worry about how to pray; but why you should pray more and not worry about the formalities, the preparations, or the length of prayer.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-short-answer\">The Short Answer</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from your desires that battle within you? You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God. - James 4:1-2</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Reliance on God begins with asking <em>him</em> to provide for us instead of ourselves. The more we rely on God, the less we sin. If we don’t talk to God through prayer, we praise him less, we ask less for forgiveness, and we rely on him less. Without prayer, we fade away spiritually and fall back to sin. Without prayer, the spiritual battle within us is lost: <em>Don’t they come from your desires that battle within you?</em> Without prayer, we die.</p>\n\n<p>If that’s not a convincing enough reason to pray more, or you want to know the <em>right</em> way to pray, then let’s go into the more encouraging answer to <em>why bother praying</em>, even in the midst of God already knowing what we’re going to say.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"conscious-reliance\">Conscious Reliance</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. - Philippians 4:6</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We start placing our burdens on God instead of ourselves when we pray. When faced with problems, the natural response needs to start becoming a desire to consult God first. God knows what we want, but if we never ask, anxiety begins to take over, and he will not provide. And as warned previously in James 4, <em>You desire but do not have, so you kill.</em> We all killed Jesus when he was crucified, all the way back to Adam and Eve. Anxiety leads to impatience and taking control, which is pride, and inevitably replacing God with yourself. So pray and make your requests known to God, with thanksgiving of what he is still doing, and you will become less anxious and more reliant on him.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"discern-gods-will\">Discern God’s Will</h3>\n\n<p>One common worry is whether or not you’re praying the <em>right</em> way, or asking God for the <em>right</em> thing. The Bible’s first response is do not let this stop you from praying, because the Holy Spirit is actively taking care of this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God. - Romans 8:26-27</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The more we pray and <em>actively seek out</em> God’s will, the more it will be revealed to us. Jesus had the following to say about praying <em>without</em> this desire:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. - Matthew 6:7</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Don’t think that God will fulfill your prayer because you used the right words, or found this one neat trick. God fulfills prayer that is aligned with his will:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is the confidence which we have before Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. - 1 John 5:14</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And we cannot <em>know</em> his will without simply <em>praying more</em> and <em>actively seeking</em> his will through this prayer.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"where-to-start\">Where to Start</h3>\n\n<p>These reasons for prayer are great, sure, but honestly what does <em>pray more</em> even mean if you don’t know how to begin? Sure the Spirit intercedes for us in our prayer, but how do we <em>start talking to God</em>? This is simple:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This, then, is how you should pray: ‘Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\nyour kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.’ - Matthew 6:9-13</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This prayer is the perfect starting point, and contains praise, thanksgiving, recognition of God’s will though we may not understand it yet, and repentance. If you begin here, you can become more comfortable speaking to God from the heart, like in the following example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Then he prayed, “Lord, God of my master Abraham, make me successful today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. May it be that when I say to a young woman, ‘Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels too’—let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.” - Genesis 24:12-14</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Even though</em> God was already fulfilling this servant’s prayer <em>before he began praying</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. - Genesis 24:15</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This man exemplifies the behavior God wants from us. Though he knew God was actively providing for him, prayer was so important in his life that he even prayed about simple errands his master sent him on. He made his requests known to God, and he had no anxiety around finding a wife for Isaac. This is what God wants from us: prayer in everything we do.</p>\n\n<p>Without prayer, we die. Without prayer, we never communicate our desires to God, though he knows them already, so we get anxious and take control. And without prayer, we never understand God’s will. There’s no worship, no thanksgiving, no petition, and no forgiveness. So pray to God, starting with Jesus’ instructions for prayer, and begin to make it your natural response to life just like Abraham’s servant.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people. - Ephesians 6:18</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

        "content"  : "<p>How do we know we’re saved? What do we have to do? There’s a lot of opinions on what it takes to receive salvation, so today we’re throwing that all out and instead looking at what examples are in the Bible. This will serve as a message to us for encouragement, because people like to complicate salvation in particular, and we know from the example of the Pharisees that harmful doctrines are formed around attempts to justify sin. Our encouragement will be that salvation is for anyone, in any situation, and at any time in history from Adam to today. But before we begin, let’s spoil the key to salvation and plainly observe the only requirements, which will be the consistent basis throughout all of scripture:</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. - Romans 10:9</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/pexels/cross.jpeg\" alt=\"Mossy cross grave\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"salvation-is-for-anyone\">Salvation is for anyone</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people - And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. - Titus 2:11/Joel 2:32</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Salvation is offered to everyone, there’s nothing you can do to exclude yourself from this. A great lie is that we may have done some great evil, or led a life so terrible, that salvation would be impossible, or that we couldn’t possibly atone for so much sin. But if this were true, then Jesus died for nothing. Instead we have nothing to atone for, and no actions or thoughts could separate us from God. Jesus died to make our wicked lives right, because otherwise it would be impossible for us to do it on our own, and no one would be saved! Salvation is for <em>everyone</em> who professes that Jesus is Lord, and believes in their heart that he died for their sins. And anyone who has sinned can do this.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"salvation-is-for-any-situation\">Salvation is for any situation</h3>\n\n<p>When Jesus was crucified, there were two criminals crucified with him as well. Neither of them were saved, and both fulfilled what was said about all humanity:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. - Romans 5:8</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>While we were still sinners</em> is the important part here. We all have sinned, and if salvation is truly possible for any situation, then it is possible <em>while we are still sinners</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him. - Mark 15:32</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These men, both condemned to die, without hope or anything left in life, <em>were still sinning</em>. But because salvation can happen in any situation, we see a transformation in one criminal that is written about in Luke.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: “Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!” But the other criminal rebuked him. “Don’t you fear God,” he said, “since you are under the same sentence? We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.” Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” Jesus answered him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.” - Luke 23:39-43</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This man led a life of sin and unrighteousness, and after receiving salvation, he neither lived a <em>new godly life</em> nor <em>anything else</em> except die on the cross with Jesus. All he did was profess that Jesus was lord, and believed in his heart what Jesus was dying for. This blows apart the lie of the Pharisees that salvation comes from scripture, following the law, gradual good change in life, or by simply being descended from Abraham. We know that this one decision by the criminal was enough to make him more righteous than any Pharisee:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. - Matthew 5:20</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Do not be deceived! It is never too late for salvation, nor is it complicated. We’re incapable of following the law perfectly, that is why God has given us another way. Profess that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that he died for your sins, and you will be saved!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"salvation-has-never-changed\">Salvation has never changed</h3>\n\n<p>This last point is to shed light on the fact that God doesn’t change, and as such neither has his requirements for salvation. This means that <em>everyone</em> in the Old Testament could receive the <em>same</em> salvation offered to us today, looking forward to Jesus instead of looking back like us. There are countless Old Testament examples of righteous people, made right by their faith alone through God’s grace, that we can therefore turn to and learn from.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God, because “the righteous will live by faith.” - Galatians 3:11</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This verse from the new testament is quoting the same thing that applied to the Jews in the Old Testament:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>See, the enemy is puffed up; his desires are not upright—but the righteous person will live by his faithfulness. - Habakkuk 2:4</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Salvation and righteousness in the Old Testament did not depend on the law, but on <em>faith</em> just like today.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.” - Romans 4:3</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Throughout history, salvation has depended on professing that Jesus is Lord, and believing today that he died for our sins, and in the Old Testament that he <em>would</em> die for our sins. We know that the Jews needed the same faith we have in the messiah because of this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone. And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” - Acts 4:11-12</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>And there is salvation in no one else</em>. Profess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that he died for your sins, and you will be saved! There is nothing more to worry about, that’s it! No matter what you’ve done, or how much more you can do, if you do this you will be saved. We have all sinned, so which criminal are you on the cross with Jesus?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.” For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” - Romans 10:10-13, which quotes the Old Testament Joel 2:32</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

What was it like during these three days? We know through example, because the Old Testament contains people who experienced pieces of Jesus’ struggles to come. This is so that <em>when</em> we experience something similar, we will be prepared. We know that we will experience pieces of Jesus’ life because we are specifically called to be more like him:</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. - Romans 8:29</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/pexels/dead.jpeg\" alt=\"Man in darkness\" /></p>\n\n<p>There are two Old Testament examples I want to share of people experiencing pieces of Jesus’ three days of death. After this we’ll better understand this specific struggle we’ve faced in life, and/or we’ll be more prepared for it in the future. Everything Jesus went through was for a reason, whether is was for prophecy or as an example. And the three days of death he went through shouldn’t be overlooked. So let’s begin with the first example.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"esther\">Esther</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish.” - Esther 4:16</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Queen Esther is told by Mordecai that she must go to her king and beg him to revoke a law put in place by a noble named Haman to kill all the Jews in the land. In the law of the country, whoever approaches the king without being called by him is to be put to death unless the king holds out his sceptre and welcomes them. Esther understands this and knows she must go to the king without being called, or else the following will happen as described by Mordecai:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father’s family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?” - Esther 4:14</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Esther also doesn’t know if the king will spare her, because what she is going to do is against the law. Her response is <em>if I perish, I perish</em>, therefore she has accepted her death if the king so chooses. For three days Esther fasts with this choice in her heart, and for three days she is dead. Have you ever made a decision like this? A decision where you’ve accepted the worst outcome, believing that it <em>will</em> happen? A decision that brings an awful dread inside, even though it’s the right thing to do? A decision that you can’t back out of, or else you and people you know will suffer terrible consequences? Esther was a willing mediator between King Xerxes and the Jews to bear the impending price of Haman’s law. For three days Esther went through what Haman desired: the death of the Jews.</p>\n\n<p>We all face decisions in life that could have terrible consequences for us, but can end with us following God’s plan. Esther could have lost her position, wealth, influence, etc. all for putting God’s people before herself. She died in her heart and mind the day she chose to help Mordecai, and during this death we get a small glimpse of Jesus’ experience of death. Jesus chose to become the exact mediator Esther represents: the mediator between God and man, bearing the price demanded by sin. Another important similarity is that Esther and Jesus were both <em>willing</em> to accept the consequence of their choice, and what Esther did during her three days are indicative of how we should respond, and show us a small glimpse of what Jesus experienced during his three days of death.</p>\n\n<p>Esther’s response was to fast while she was dead in her heart and mind. Fasting brings our focus to God alone, taking our attention away from the world and what we’re asked to surrender. When Jesus fasted in the wilderness, he quotes part of this important passage in response to Satan’s temptation to eat:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord. - Deuteronomy 8:3</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When Esther died in heart and mind, her body lived because while she fasted she lived on <em>every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord</em>. Similarly, when Jesus’ body died, his spirit lived on <em>every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit. - 1 Peter 3:18</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Have you ever been given a choice to follow God and possibly lose your life, or your influence, or your money, or your friends? Enter willingly and fast, focusing on God and living on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord. Do this and you shall be made <em>alive</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the palace, in front of the king’s hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the hall, facing the entrance. When he saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter. - Esther 5:1-2</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"jonah\">Jonah</h3>\n\n<p>What if you’ve not been willing to follow God? What if you’ve made the wrong choice, and you put God last? What if you’re trying to escape God’s plan? Jonah, a prophet of God, didn’t do what Esther did, he tried to escape God’s plan. But God is merciful and gives us second chances. However, God will put us through an experience to teach us how to continue. After Jonah tries to escape from God’s plan, he winds up in the sea, and his three days of death begin:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now the LORD provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. - Jonah 1:17</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The question about this example is how is this similar to Jesus? Jesus didn’t try to escape his father’s plan. But what Jesus did was bear the consequence for <em>our</em> failure to follow God’s plan. Jesus experienced what Jonah went through because he took on these mistakes, these failures, these sins, so that on this day we wouldn’t have to. We know Jonah and Jesus are connected because of this prophecy:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. - Matthew 12:40</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jonah shows us the most specific experience of death that Jesus felt. And we know that Jonah felt dead because of how he describes this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the Lord his God.\nHe said:\n“In my distress I called to the Lord,\nand he answered me.\nFrom deep in the realm of the dead I called for help,\nand you listened to my cry.\nYou hurled me into the depths,\ninto the very heart of the seas,\nand the currents swirled about me;\nall your waves and breakers\nswept over me.\nI said, ‘I have been banished\nfrom your sight;\nyet I will look again\ntoward your holy temple.’\nThe engulfing waters threatened me,\nthe deep surrounded me;\nseaweed was wrapped around my head.\nTo the roots of the mountains I sank down;\nthe earth beneath barred me in forever.\nBut you, Lord my God,\nbrought my life up from the pit.\nWhen my life was ebbing away,\nI remembered you, Lord,\nand my prayer rose to you,\nto your holy temple.\nThose who cling to worthless idols\nturn away from God’s love for them.\nBut I, with shouts of grateful praise,\nwill sacrifice to you.\nWhat I have vowed I will make good.\nI will say, ‘Salvation comes from the Lord.’”</p>\n\n  <p>And the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land. - Jonah 2</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does Jonah’s experience describe something you’ve gone through, or are going through now? Are you ignoring God’s plan, or have you put something in place of him? Are you running away? Do you feel dead, lost, alone, or in the dark? When Jesus died, he was alone in the heart of the earth. He was in the darkness, dead and lost. Even God turned his back, and <em>to the roots of the mountains</em> Jesus sank down. So what do you do about it? What caused God to release Jonah?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“But I, with shouts of grateful praise,\nwill sacrifice to you.\nWhat I have vowed I will make good.\nI will say, ‘Salvation comes from the Lord.’” - Jonah 2:9</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Return to God. Profess that he is Lord, and believe in your heart that Jesus paid the price of sin for you. If you’re experiencing the death Jonah went through, there’s something in the way between you and God, and it must be removed. In your time of loneliness, darkness, and hopelessness, use it as your time of fasting and turn your eyes to God.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you are willing to follow or you’re trying to escape God, you will experience pieces of Jesus’ death in your life, just like Esther and Jonah. We are called by God to be more like Jesus, and even though we may be going through one of these types of death, we know that Jesus conquered this for us. Whatever pain or temptation you’re experiencing, Jesus has experienced:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin. - Hebrews 4:15</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If we return to God, if we never lose sight of him, he promises deliverance from the death we may be experiencing. It may very well not be three days specifically for you, but it was for Esther and Jonah so that we may look and see their simple connections to Jesus. The point of this message is that God delivered the willing Esther and unwilling Jonah, because in the end they both followed him. God <em>will</em> deliver you if you do the same:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices;\n    my body also will rest secure,\nbecause you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead,\n    nor will you let your faithful one see decay.\nYou make known to me the path of life;\n    you will fill me with joy in your presence,\n    with eternal pleasures at your right hand. - Psalm 16:9-11</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

        "content"  : "<p>God is always talking. Sometimes people hear him, sometimes they don’t. There’s a lot of stories out there about people <em>hearing</em> God or <em>knowing</em> what his plan is for them. But what about when you don’t? What about when you feel like God isn’t saying anything? I believe there’s two things to consider when this happens: you can’t hear anything because there is sin in the way, and/or you haven’t discovered how God wants to uniquely talk to you. The first reason comes from Isaiah, after a sermon at my church covered this incredible text, and the second comes from personal experience and various scriptures.\n<!--more--></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/pexels/marketing-man-person-communication.jpg\" alt=\"Man talking through can\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"there-is-sin-in-the-way\">There is sin in the way</h3>\n\n<p>In Isaiah 6, simply put the prophet Isaiah encounters God. In this fantastic display, Isaiah realizes how unworthy he is to be before God. This is because to be before something so holy and perfect means that our imperfections and failures become all the more obvious.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Woe to me!” I cried. “I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Immediately after this, a seraphim touches his mouth with coal from God’s altar.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With it he touched my mouth and said, “See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And all the wrong in Isaiah’s life is taken away. At that very moment, he is made right with God. But the important thing to note here is what happens after this, what happens after the sin in Isaiah’s life is out of the way. Now, the Bible is purposeful in how its words are arranged, and sometimes the little things shouldn’t be glossed over. The next verse in this chapter begins with:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It does <em>not</em> say “Then the Lord said,” or “I heard the Lord say.” It says <em>then</em> I heard the voice of the Lord <em>saying</em>. God was talking the whole time, and only <em>now</em> does Isaiah hear the Lord <em>saying</em> anything. Only after Isaiah recognizes his sin, and after his sins are taken away, can he hear what God has been saying the whole time. This happened to Isaiah for us to understand that sin gets in the way of hearing God. That is why I believe it is the first and most important thing to look for if we’re wondering why we may not be “hearing” anything, or why we feel like there’s something gnawing at us when we ask God to speak. God is always talking, and it’s forgiveness that allows us hear him.</p>\n\n<p>But what about after this? What about after forgiveness, after the guilt and the shame is removed from our lives? You may feel like you sometimes hear God, but not always. You get glimpses, but never the whole thing. Sometimes it makes sense, and sometimes you’re just left confused. Or maybe you’re still not hearing anything at all? Forgiveness, that first step, changes us. And God is always drawing us towards the opposite of who we used to be. Before we go into this, know this simple promise:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my loving eye on you. - Psalm 32:8</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"god-knows-your-language-do-you\">God knows your language, do you?</h3>\n\n<p>Behavioral assessments like Myers–Briggs or DISC tell us how we prefer to interact with people, and how we prefer to be interacted with. We all have different minds, personalities, and behaviors, so we see and miss different things in life. They are our flaws and our strengths. But this is not something God takes into account, because if we approach God blameless and with forgiven sin, he’s going to talk to us in a whole new way, a way that isn’t concerned with our pasts, our personalities, or our human nature.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. - 2 Corinthians 5:17</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The only way I felt I could further explain how God communicates with us is through a part of my life story. My personality feeds off of control, certainty, explanations, and results. This causes incredible worry and doubt when things aren’t going great. But this is also <em>all</em> fixed by complete trust in God. Trust requires us to get rid of our pride and put something other than ourselves in its place. The first time I practiced this was in college, and I was interested in a girl. At the time I was trying to pray more, and was still only getting <em>glimpses</em> of God talking to me. I felt like this was a good opportunity to practice something I read  about in the Bible around that time:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“‘Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,’ says the Lord Almighty, ‘and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it.’” - Malachi 3:10</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wanted to <em>test</em> God by giving him my complete trust, and seeing what he would do with it, because I knew he would do something. I prayed to God that if this girl was not right for me, for him to take her away from my life so that I wouldn’t have to think about her anymore. I had to believe that this was how he was going to communicate his plan to me, and what I gave up in return was control over my relationships, worry over making the wrong decisions, and thinking that I knew what was good for me. The next day I went to class and she wasn’t there. A week later I asked a friend about her, and he said she dropped out for some reason. It was at that moment a great weight was lifted, and I knew with absolute certainty that I had nothing to worry about anymore, because God is to this day taking care of me.</p>\n\n<p>The point of this short story about my life is that this is how God talks to me. I can’t hear him unless my sins are forgiven, and when he talks to me he’s expecting absolute trust. I had to make that leap, and it gets easier and easier the more I give to him. Other possible relationships have all been dealt with in the same way, and God has <em>always</em> done what I asked. When it comes to relationships, this is how God talks to me. It is nearly the same for everything else in my life.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.” - John 15:5</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>God is always talking to us, but sometimes we can’t quite make out the words. Find out how God is talking to you and what he’s saying by first asking for forgiveness like Isaiah, and then start trusting him with decisions, problems, and your life. He wants you to give your worries to him, he wants you to hear him, and he wants you to trust him.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will. - Romans 12:2</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

For example, a simple glance on <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/15436.Most_original\">Goodreads’</a> list of most original books contains countless novels that nearly everyone has at least read or heard of. What made them unique? In general, it was their story. Now you might be thinking that this article is about how to make a creative story, however, I’ll be taking a different approach. There’s already thousands of articles and even books on how to create creative stories, so I don’t want to add another to the pile.\n<!--more--></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/pexels/juliet-is-the-sun.jpeg\" alt=\"Juliet is the Sun handwritten on an iPad\" /></p>\n\n<p>In this article, we’ll be looking at how grammar can help make a work of literature unique. When I began writing, I was constantly worried that my tales might conflict with the millions of other books out there. I wanted to find a way to create my work differently, to find another angle of presentation, and also increase my writing skill at the same time. Once I found a way, it helped make the story differentiate itself from others quite well.</p>\n\n<p>Now there’s no rule to follow to create a different grammar style, but I’ll share what I did in hopes that it might help someone find their own way.</p>\n\n<p>Here was my plan:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"have-a-story\">Have a story</h3>\n\n<p>Before I thought about the presentation of my writing, I had to have a story. There are several types of writers, and some can begin writing immediately, some need to write outlines, and some need to just think about it for a while. It took me a long time to simply think about it and get it together, but that’s my creative process and it worked for me. Find your best method.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"find-what-stresses-your-capabilities\">Find what stresses your capabilities</h3>\n\n<p>Your writing ability needs to be pushed to the point where you’ve reached something that you don’t think you can write about. I discovered a few exotic works of literature that intrigued me, and they were all <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-lipogram-1691244\">lipograms</a>, a form of constrained writing. One was Gadsby by Ernest Vincent Wright, which doesn’t contain the letter “e” throughout the entire book. There were several others, and they all practiced similar constrained writing methods. I thought that this might be interesting, and it was certainly something I didn’t think I could do for an entire novel. This may not be you, but I didn’t want the sole focus of my story to be on the constrained writing quality. I felt that it would instead enhance its presentation in a deeper way, and be a supplemental factor to the language of the book.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"employ-your-tactic\">Employ your tactic</h3>\n\n<p>“Juliet is the sun” (From Romeo and Juliet) is in my opinion one of the most powerful metaphors you can find. I wanted this same strength in my story, and I also wanted to use a constrained writing method. So then what? Well I thought about how powerful metaphors are both in design and writing. Then I thought about the weakness of the metaphor: The Simile.</p>\n\n<p>“Juliet is like the sun” simply isn’t as special as the original quote, and doesn’t show the same inherent qualities attempted to be conveyed. For, Juliet is the sun. She doesn’t have similar qualities that sun has, but the same qualities. In fact, there’s no difference between the two.</p>\n\n<p>My tactic? I would use constrained writing and never use any common similes. Yes, the definition of a simile isn’t limited to comparison using “like” or “as” but it was a start, and would remove any direct similes. I would be forced to use metaphors for comparison.</p>\n\n<p>Now similes can be incredibly beautiful, especially in poetic writing, but I made a decision to omit their use entirely for the purpose of being constrained and forced to find a harder route. My book needed to be difficult to write so as to pay attention to each sentence with the same care as the last.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"your-tactic-may-hinder-progress-in-the-beginning-but-it-has-lasting-benefits\">Your tactic may hinder progress in the beginning, but it has lasting benefits</h3>\n\n<p>While the words “like” and “as” never show up in my story, I never realized how much we naturally use them. For example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“As they walked past a tree, it looked like it might fall.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The occurrences of “like” and “as” may not even be direct comparisons, but I had to stick with my rule and find a different way of communicating my idea:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“While they walked past a tree, it showed signs that it might fall.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Though simple fixes, they really made me think through every single sentence. It was a pain for a while, but eventually my brain began to think without common similes, and it became a habit of not using them. Although more prominent in descriptions of people and things, metaphors dig deeper the more you use them and the less you use similes.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s an excerpt from <em>Portents of a Weeping World</em> that shows a part of the result of omitting similes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“It was all the earth that reflected the light and beauty of her face. Her hair was a waterfall, ever flowing and setting the stars. Her lips the springtime roses blooming, full and void of imperfection, yet wielding beneath their splendor a tongue grasping thorns that pierce if unheeded. Her eyes bore the flames of fluent jasper, trailing into smoke of agate and diamond. She was the end of bedlam, master of all the wonderful, and empress of the empyreans. She turned and faced Daeon, he lost all breath and could not hold her gaze.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As I said before, this article is about my method, and isn’t intended to be a rule or solution for finding a unique grammar style, merely an idea to find your own. You may not even want or need to find one, but if you’re looking for a way to further make your book special and differentiate itself from the masses, this might help. It doesn’t even have to be grammar! But try and dig deeper than the story, and think about its presentation.</p>\n"
