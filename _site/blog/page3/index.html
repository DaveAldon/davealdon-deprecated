              Temptation comes from many sources, which people mostly attribute directly to Satan. But if that was the only source, then Adam and Eve would have probably never sinned. So where else do sinful decisions come from? There are many things described negatively in the Bible, and one in particular is spoiled in the title of this post: our heart. In fact, even Satan himself is not as deceitful as our heart, and we know this because of this very blunt description:

              People pray in many different ways, whether it’s more formal, written and practiced, or casually and in a conversational manner. Either way, it’s how we consciously communicate with God. But because God knows our thoughts and desires before we tell them to him, what’s the point of praying?

              How do we know we’re saved? What do we have to do? There’s a lot of opinions on what it takes to receive salvation, so today we’re throwing that all out and instead looking at what examples are in the Bible. This will serve as a message to us for encouragement, because people like to complicate salvation in particular, and we know from the example of the Pharisees that harmful doctrines are formed around attempts to justify sin. Our encouragement will be that salvation is for anyone, in any situation, and at any time in history from Adam to today. But before we begin, let’s spoil the key to salvation and plainly observe the only requirements, which will be the consistent basis throughout all of scripture:

  He said, “It is finished!” And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit. - John 19:30


When Jesus died, he stayed that way for three days before coming back to life. What was it like during these three days? We know through example, because the Old Testament contains people who experienced pieces of Jesus’ struggles to come. This is so that when we experience something similar, we will be prepared. We know that we will experience pieces of Jesus’ life because we are specifically called to be more like him:

              God is always talking. Sometimes people hear him, sometimes they don’t. There’s a lot of stories out there about people hearing God or knowing what his plan is for them. But what about when you don’t? What about when you feel like God isn’t saying anything? I believe there’s two things to consider when this happens: you can’t hear anything because there is sin in the way, and/or you haven’t discovered how God wants to uniquely talk to you. The first reason comes from Isaiah, after a sermon at my church covered this incredible text, and the second comes from personal experience and various scriptures.
