              You’re on your first date with someone and the waiter asks that question going on in everyone’s head: all together, or separate?



You make eye contact with the other person at the table and the awkwardness begins to rise.



Why does this happen and why is this a problem? It’s because you weren’t prepared for it, and the underlying issue is a vast rabbit-hole of social problems and perspective. “Who pays for the first date?” is a heated issue, and for Christians and only Christians, there is a righteous answer. I’m not talking about restaurants and money, but what these dinner experiences have an affect on: our relationships and an imitation of Christ. We’re going to look at the most powerful, clear examples of who “pays for dinner,” in the Bible. Through this, we’ll understand why the question the waiter always asks is important for Christians, and only Christians, to answer.

              Live for now. Follow your truth. Your story is your legacy. Falling in love with yourself isn’t vanity, it’s sanity.

All these sayings have one dangerous thing in common: perspective. Perspective is how you see everything in life, including yourself, and more importantly, God. Perspective is one of many things that make us human, but the good thing is that our perspective can change. However, because it can change, that means there can be problematic perspectives, and wholly good perspectives. Today we’re looking at how God sees everything, and how it contrasts with man. Because we’re called to imitate Christ, we should understand God’s perspective, and change ours to be more like his.

              In many allegories, movies, or hypotheses about Jesus’ younger years, a very particular idea tends to sneak in. It’s the idea that Jesus, while a young boy, learned that he was God through some journey, revelation, maturity, or whatever. These ideas may even go so far as to say that he learned he was God at the time he began his ministry, and therefore for the majority of his life he was not aware of his divinity. Now, while this idea may seem harmless, it’s an attempt to fill in the gaps of Jesus’ life. Indeed, there isn’t an exact account of Jesus’ entire life in scripture, but it turns out that the Bible fills in the gaps for us. We’re going to answer the question of whether or not Jesus knew he was God as a child, and what he was up to before his ministry.

              What comes to mind when you think about communion? Probably what you eat and drink, and the verses from the Lord’s supper where Jesus talks about what communion is all about. These are all great things, but I want to add more value to them by drawing on acts of communion found in the Old Testament as well. Nothing in the New Testament shows us anything new. This means that all traditions, festivals, and laws found in the New Testament all come from the Old Testament. Now, if communion didn’t start in the New Testament, shouldn’t we look at examples of where it came from, in order to better understand where it is now? Yes, so let’s begin by breaking down what communion is, and applying this definition to an example in the Old Testament.

              Baptism is undoubtedly a controversial topic within various denominations in Christianity. But when we ask ourselves when baptism started, I’m 100% sure it’s always John the Baptist that comes to mind. Today we’re putting a stop to this, because the New Testament neither invented anything new, nor abolished anything old, but fulfilled every law and prophecy that came out of the Old Testament. While the word baptism isn’t in the Old Testament, its latin definition, “immersion,” very much occurs all over the place. And if it’s there, it’s important. We’re going to look at baptism in the Old Testament, and why this is important to understand.
