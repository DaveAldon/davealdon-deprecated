>He said, “It is finished!” And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit. - John 19:30

When Jesus died, he stayed that way for three days before coming back to life. What was it like during these three days? We know through example, because the Old Testament contains people who experienced pieces of Jesus’ struggles. This is so that we may both better understand God today, and better understand the prophecy leading up to Jesus’ sacrifice. We’ll look at several major Old Testament examples of people experiencing pieces of Jesus’ three days, and then finally *why* it was three days to tie it back to the fulfillment of prophecy.
