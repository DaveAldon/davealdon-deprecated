Really all you need to know for starters is that I'm a Christian and I've been writing simple books for a couple years. I want to be more vocal about my convictions because I love Jesus and he has become my life, so I'm sharing what I learn about God, and what I'm working on lately. If you have questions or want to talk about stuff, please email me at <davealdonbooks@gmail.com>.
