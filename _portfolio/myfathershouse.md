This book is for fathers, soon-to-be fathers, might-be fathers, hopeful fathers, and anyone who wants to learn about fathers and their role in a family. Written with the scriptures placed first, everything in here comes directly from the Bible, spanning across the Old and New Testament. You will encounter fantastic scripture you may have either never even known to have existed, or you will see them from a new perspective that explores even more meaning behind the vast wisdom God has placed inside the Bible.
